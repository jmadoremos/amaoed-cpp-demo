The characteristics of JavaScript:
* It is a scripting language
* It is interpreted
* It is case-sensitive
* It supports single-line and multi-line comments

### Java

* Only multiple statements in one line require semicolon (;)
* Keywords  are allowed to use as identifies

### PHP

---

Attributed to Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP is the language of the Web as mostly used in Back-end Web Development. It is curated by the open source community with a wide range of community-developed libraries. It is still the most used programming language in Web Development due to its flexible nature and a wide range of free hosting services that supports PHP.

* It is loosely type language
* It is a real time access monitoring
* It has some predefined error reporting constants to generate a warning or error notice
* It provides nowdocs and heredocs  String

### C++

---

Attributed by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ is the successor of the low-level programming language, C. It supports low-level control over the entire computer system and gives utmost flexibility to the developers in terms of capability. Alongside C Programming Language, C++ is still one of the fastest programming languages capable of heavy computing.

![Bjarne Stroustrup][bjarne_stroustrup]

The characteristics of C++ are:
* It is an Object-oriented Programming Language
* It has a huge function library
* It is a machine independent language
* It is suitable for development of Reusable software

### C#

---

Attributed to Anders Hejsberg, C# is one of the most used programming language in Game Development. This is attributed to its heavy orientation towards Object-oriented programming.

![Anders Hejsberg][anders_hejsberg]

The characteristics of C# are:
* It is an Object-oriented Program Language
* It supports Data Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and interfaces
* It cannot perform unsafe casts like convert double to a Boolean
* It includes native support for the COM and windows based applications

### Go

---

Attributed to Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, Go/Golang is an open-source programming language created at Google with memory safety and garbage collection.

![Robert Griesemer][robert_griesemer]

Shell is a scripting language used in accessing, administering and managing Unix-based operating systems.

![Shell][shell]

The characteristics of Shell are:
* It has a Wildcard substitution in file names (pattern-matching)
* It gives an alias name to a command or phrase.
* It automatically produces a list of file names on a command line using pattern-matching characters
* It stores data in user-defined variables and predefined shell variables.

### Objective-C

---

Attributed to Brad Cox, Objective-C is one of the most popular version of C Programming Language.

![Brad Cox][brad_cox]

The characteristics of Objective-C are:
* It is a superset of C but it can also understand and call C++ code
* It has a dynamic run-time 
* It has expressive message syntax
* It is use to Apple Technologies
* Introspection object is easy
